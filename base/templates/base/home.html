					<h4>My First Jov as a Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<p> 3 month after writing my first Hello World proqram on June (while working in the marketing department) I had convinced my boss to let me take a stab(an attempt to do(something)) at buliding a better version of the outdated labaratory managment system my company was running on.</p>
					<p>Before I knew it we transitioned from the old system and we're on to mine. My newbie self was now in charge of hosting hundreds of thousands of lab samples and supporting thousands of clients. </p>
					<p>From this you'll see I;m someone that jumps before I can talk myself out doing something scary</p>
